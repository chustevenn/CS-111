The contents of this directory are as follows:

1) lab1b-server.c

This compiles into an executable that creates and binds a TCP socket. It listens on a specified port, and 
accepts a connection when it is made. After this connection is made, it will fork a child shell process
and use that shell to process commands sent from the client.

This executable supports the options:
	
	--port=PORT#		Mandatory option, user passes an argument to specify the port of the network socket
	--shell=PROGRAM		User passes an argument to this option to specify the program run by child
	--compress		Option to enable compression of all traffic in both directions on the socket


2) lab1b-client.c

This compiles into an executable that connects to a running server on the same port. It then puts the 
keyboard into character-at-a-time, no-echo input mode. Otherwise knwon as non-canonical input mode with
no echo. It sends input to the server, and outputs the server's responses to the terminal.

This executable supports the options:

	--port=PORT#		Mandatory option, user passes an argument to specify the port of the network socket
	--log=FILE		Option to log all data sent and received by the client into FILE.
	--compress		Option to enable compression of all traffic in both directions on the socket


2) Makefile

This is a Makefile with the following options:

	default: Compile the lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables with extra warnings
	client: Compile the lab1b-client executable with extra warnings
	server: Compile the lab1b-server executable with extra warnings
	clean: Remove files created by 'make', 'make client', 'make server', or 'make dist'
	dist: Compress and create the distribution tarball
